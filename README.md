Language Detection with Python
Overview
This project implements a language detection model using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It preprocesses text data, applies machine learning algorithms, and evaluates performance using various metrics.

Features
Text Preprocessing: Normalizes and tokenizes input text.
Machine Learning Models: Utilizes algorithms like Naive Bayes for language classification.
Feature Extraction: Employs CountVectorizer to convert text into numerical data.
Performance Evaluation: Measures accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Required libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, nltk
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd language-detection
Install the required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Experimenting with Sample Data
Place your sample text data in the data folder.
Modify the sample_data.py file to load your sample data.
Run the Jupyter Notebook language_detection.ipynb to train the model and evaluate its performance on the sample data.
Evaluation Metrics
The model performance will be evaluated using:

Accuracy: Overall correctness of the predictions.
Precision: Correct positive predictions divided by total positive predictions.
Recall: Correct positive predictions divided by actual positives.
F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Usage
This language detection model can be used for:

Text analysis
Content moderation
Automated translation services
