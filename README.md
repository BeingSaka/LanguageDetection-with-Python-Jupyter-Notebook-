## Language Detection with Python
This project implements a language detection model using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It preprocesses text data, applies machine learning algorithms, and evaluates performance using various metrics. The model helps in automating language identification and supports a wide range of applications.

## Key features include:

	* Text Preprocessing: Normalize and tokenize input text for consistent analysis.
	* Machine Learning Models: Employ algorithms like Naive Bayes for accurate language classification.
	* Feature Extraction: Convert text into numerical data using CountVectorizer for effective model training.
	* Performance Evaluation: Assess accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to measure the model's effectiveness.

# The project is designed to offer solutions for:

	* Text Analysis: Simplify content analysis and categorization across multiple languages.
	* Content Moderation: Filter and monitor multilingual user-generated content efficiently.
	* Automated Translation Services: Preprocess and detect text language to optimize translation workflows.
