# LanguageDetection-with-Python-Jupyter-Notebook-
This project detects languages from text using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It preprocesses text, applies machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, and uses CountVectorizer for feature extraction. Performance is evaluated with metrics such as accuracy and F1 score, making it suitable for text analysis and translation.
